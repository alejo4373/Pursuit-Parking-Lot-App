# aftercovid-19

aftercovid-19 is a website where you can post a sticky note about something you want to do or something you learned after (and during) covid-19 for you to share with the world.

The intent is to reflect about what covid-19 has meant for you, your loved ones, how it changed your perception of the world as well as what you want to do with that earned perspective.

### Examples:

#### I have learned
* Healthcare workers are the real heroes!
* Our small collective actions matter and make an impact.
* How to build a website

#### I want to do 
* Start planting a forest or contribute to an already existing one.
* Visit my sisters, embrace them and tell them I love them.
* Learn to swim.
