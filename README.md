# aftercovid-19

aftercovid-19 is a website where you can post a sticky note about something you want to do or something you learned after (and during) covid-19 for you to share with the world.

The intent is to reflect about what covid-19 has meant for you, your loved ones, how it changed your perception of the world as well as what you want to do with that earned perspective.
